## Announcement : Something went wrong

### An error was found while developing. Normally, Players aren't supposed to collide with enemies. The problem is that somehow, few parts were able to collide with the enemies.
### Lucifer is working to fix the error. However, this error was caused by script fixes, so it needs some time for it to be actually fixed.
### The error will be fixed as soon as possible. This error is needed to be fixed since this error is fatal and makes the game too easy.
